## Grove

#### **This is an [android experiment](http://androidexperiments.com).**

### Description

This is the source code of Grove, my first google android experiment. For more information visit [https://www.androidexperiments.com/](https://www.androidexperiments.com/).

This app was built using [Cinder](https:://libcinder.org) an awesome and modern c++ library for creative coding created by Andrew Bell and Hai Nguyen. Many thanks to Hai for his amazing work at porting Cinder to Android and his countless hours of help to solve all the platform related issues. Many thanks as well to [David Thomas and Julien Diels](http://www.brains-agency.be) for re-drawing all the icons used in the app.

### Instruction to build

* clone cinder_android branch
* clone this repository in an "apps" folder created at the same level as cinder
* add the content of [Triangulation](https://github.com/simongeilfus/Triangulation) and [PoissonDiskDistribution](https://github.com/simongeilfus/PoissonDiskDistribution) to the src folder
* open and build the androidstudio project
