## Triangulation

This was originally written for [Grove](https://github.com/simongeilfus/GroveApp) and will probably be turned into a cinder block at some point with proper documentation and samples.
In the meantime it should be straightforward to use and should work with any recent version of [Cinder](https:://libcinder.org).

The triangulation algorithm was extracted from OpenCV, see licence in the cpp file.
